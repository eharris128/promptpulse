## Leaderboard Participation

### Opt-in to Competition

The leaderboard is completely opt-in. To participate:

1. Visit your dashboard Settings page
2. Enable "Leaderboard Participation"
3. Optionally set a custom display name
4. Your usage will appear in daily and weekly rankings

### Privacy Information

**When leaderboard is enabled:**
- Your token usage and costs are included in rankings
- Your username or display name is shown publicly
- Your ranking position and percentile are calculated
- No other personal information is shared

**When leaderboard is disabled:**
- Your data is completely private
- You can still view the leaderboard but won't appear on it
- You can re-enable participation at any time

## Data Sources

PromptPulse reads your Claude Code usage data from:
- `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (default location)
- `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects/**/*.jsonl` (if custom path set)

This includes:
- Token usage (input, output, cache creation, cache read)
- Model information and pricing
- Timestamps and session data
- Cost calculations

## Multi-User Support

### How It Works
- Each user has a unique API key for authentication
- All data is completely isolated between users
- Multiple team members can track usage independently
- Machines can be shared or user-specific

### Use Cases
- **Teams** - Each developer tracks their own Claude usage
- **Freelancers** - Separate usage by client projects
- **Personal** - Track usage across work and personal machines

## Security & Privacy

- üîê API keys provide secure authentication
- üè† All data is isolated per user account
- üåê Hosted service - no local database required
- üìù Logs contain no sensitive information
- üö´ No personal data beyond usage statistics
